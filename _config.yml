  Hello there, 

  My name is Antonio Sebastián Dromundo Escobedo, and I'm a *computer scientist*.

  Developer, geek, guitarist, and swimmer, I'm passionate about **open-source projects** and making technology accessible for **everyone**.

  I'm curious about **data science** and **cloud computing**, looking to bring the benefits of computer science to non-related fields.

  I made a brief incursion to agronomic science. It led me to reflect if tech advances are getting to all the people that need them.

  **My life project** is to make technology a pillar of everyday life in Latin America.
  Education, science, and well-living for all.

  > <mark>You just have to make it fun.<mark>

          During my studies, I've learned strong foundations on **algorithms** and **data structures**. I've programmed with functional programming acquiring a good notion of *robustness* and *security* in programs. I care about **code efficiency** and **algorithm optimization**.

          I founded a *Computer Science Club* to share resources and provide help to newer students. It has helped me to develop my **teamwork** and **leading** skills.

  #     This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

  #     Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
